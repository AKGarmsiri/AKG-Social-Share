    <h1>AKG Social Share Instructions</h1>

    <p>The AKG Social Share plugin is a simple way to let your visitors share your WordPress posts on social media.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>To install the plugin, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Download the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository or from the GitHub repository.</li>
        <li>Upload the plugin to your WordPress site by navigating to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin, then selecting the .zip file you downloaded.</li>
        <li>Activate the plugin by navigating to Plugins and clicking "Activate" under AKG Social Share.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>To display the social media sharing links on your WordPress posts or pages, use the following shortcode:</p>

    <pre>[akg_social_share]</pre>

    <p>You can also customize which social media links are displayed using the following attributes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>facebook</code> - Set to "yes" to display the Facebook sharing link, or "no" to hide it.</li>
        <li><code>twitter</code> - Set to "yes" to display the Twitter sharing link, or "no" to hide it.</li>
        <li><code>linkedin</code> - Set to "yes" to display the LinkedIn sharing link, or "no" to hide it.</li>
        <li><code>whatsapp</code> - Set to "yes" to display the WhatsApp sharing link, or "no" to hide it.</li>
        <li><code>instagram</code> - Set to "yes" to display the Instagram sharing link, or "no" to hide it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, to display the Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn sharing links only, use the following shortcode:</p>

    <pre>[akg_social_share facebook="yes" twitter="yes" linkedin="yes" whatsapp="no" instagram="no"]</pre>

    <p>You can place the shortcode anywhere in your post or page content to display the social media sharing links.</p>

    <h2>Customization</h2>

    <p>If you'd like to customize the look and feel of the social media sharing links, you can use CSS to style them however you like. The social media icons are generated using Font Awesome, so you can use any of the Font Awesome icons to replace the default ones.</p>

    <p>Here's an example CSS snippet to change the background color of the social media icons:</p>

    <pre>
.akg-social-share a {
    background-color: #333;
}
</pre>

    <p>Feel free to experiment with different CSS styles to make the social media sharing links fit your website's design.</p>
